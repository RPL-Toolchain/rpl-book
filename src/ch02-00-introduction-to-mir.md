# Introduction To MIR

Before delving into the specifics of RPL's pattern modeling language, this chapter will first provide an introduction to Rust's Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR). A foundational understanding of MIR is essential, as RPL's entire approach to modeling function logic is directly based on its structure and semantics. Accordingly, the following sections will begin with an overview of MIR before proceeding to a detailed guide on the pattern modeling language itself.
