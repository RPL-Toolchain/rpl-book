# The Pattern Modeling Language

The RPL linter consists of two primary components:

1. a domain-specific language for modeling code patterns (It is important to note that while the name RPL originally referred specifically to this modeling language, it has since been broadened to encompass the entire linter toolchain. Consequently, the modeling language itself is currently without a formal name. However, the file extension of the pattern modeling language is still `.rpl`.)
2. a general graph matching engine that serves as the backend.

This chapter will focus exclusively on providing a comprehensive introduction to this pattern modeling language.
